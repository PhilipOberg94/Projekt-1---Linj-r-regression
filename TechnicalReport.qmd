# Abstract
A brief summary of the report, including the purpose, methodology, results, and conclusions of the linear regression project focused on temperature prediction.

# Introduction
## Background
Introduce the concept of linear regression and its importance in data analysis and machine learning. Mention the specific application of predicting room temperature using data from a temperature sensor.

## Objective
State the objective of the project, such as implementing a linear regression model to predict room temperature and comparing it to readings from a more advanced temperature sensor.

## Scope
Define the scope of the project, including the dataset used, the sensors involved, and the specific problem being addressed.

# Methodology
## Data Collection
Describe the process of collecting data from the temperature sensor. Include details about the sensors used, the environment, and any preprocessing steps taken.

## Linear Regression Model
Explain the linear regression model, including the mathematical formulation and assumptions. Provide details on the implementation in `Linreg.cpp` and `LinReg.h`.

## Implementation
Provide details on how the model was implemented, including any software or libraries used (e.g., Python, NumPy, scikit-learn). Include code snippets from `Linreg.cpp` and `LinReg.h`.

# Results
## Model Training
Describe the process of training the linear regression model, including the training and testing split.

## Performance Metrics
Present the metrics used to evaluate the model's performance, such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared, etc.

## Visualizations
Include plots and graphs that illustrate the model's performance, such as scatter plots with the regression line, residual plots, etc.

# Discussion
## Analysis of Results
Interpret the results obtained from the model, discussing any patterns or insights observed.

## Comparison with Advanced Sensor
Compare the predictions from the linear regression model with the readings from the more advanced temperature sensor.

## Limitations
Discuss any limitations of the model or the dataset that may have affected the results.

## Improvements
Suggest potential improvements or future work that could enhance the model's performance.

# Conclusion
Summarize the key findings of the project, reiterating the importance of linear regression in data analysis and the insights gained from the project.
