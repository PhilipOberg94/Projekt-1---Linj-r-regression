# `ATmega328P` library

## Description
Library containing miscellaneous drivers and containers for microcontroller `ATmega328P`.  
The code is written in C++17 and adapted for Microchip Studio. 


## Content
The library includes the following drivers:  
* `ADC`: Driver for the `ATmega328P` ADC.  
* `EEPROM`: Driver for utilization of the `ATmega328P` EEPROM.  
* `GPIO`: Generic driver for GPIO devices.  
* `Timer`: Driver for the `ATmega328P` hardware timers.  
* `Serial`: Driver for serial transmission via USART.  
* `Watchdog`: Driver for the `ATmega328P` watchdog timer.  

The library includes the following generic containers:  
* `Array`: Implementation of static arrays of any data type.  
* `CallbackArray`: Implementation of callback arrays of arbitrary size.  
* `List`: Implementation of doubly linked lists of any data type.  
* `Pair`: Implementation of pairs containing values of any data type.  
* `Vector`: Implementation of dynamic vectors of any data type.  

The library also includes miscellaneous utility functions, type traits etc.  

## Usage 
This library must be opened in a Windows environment to build.  
Copy the library into a Windows path, such as the C drive, before building.

## Review questions
What did we learn? - We have learned about basic linear regression, how to program i C++ and to interpret an existing code base.

What was hard/easy? - The hardest thing was to interpret an existing code base, and to correctly use the built in functions to implement in our model.

What would we wanted to know more of before the project? - What we would have liked to worked more with is the basics of C++, like the syntax and OOP.

Other comments -  We look forward to work with a more advanced model.
